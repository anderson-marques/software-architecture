# How to Scope Microservices Using Bounded Contexts

## Bounded Context

- Starts of as a core domain concept
- Internal model (supporting concepts)
- Each BC has an explicit interface (api?)
- Shared models for communication (internal communication)
- Microservice = Bounded context
  - Belongs to a team
  - Own repository and data store
  - Contracts
- Depending on the size of the bounded context it can be splited into multiples microservices
  - It is like systems and sub-systems
- Logical bounded context
- When we see models that are out of the context this probably represents a relation between other microservices
